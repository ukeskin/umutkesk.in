    <h3>Are code agents doing magic? (2025)</h3>
    <p><i>Spoiler: They mostly read & write files in a loop—no wands required.</i></p>
    <p>
        Before we dive in, export an environment variable so the agent can talk to OpenRouter.
        Below is a minimal JavaScript agent built in four scroll steps. As you read, the code grows side‑by‑side with the explanation.

        <p>Code agents are just <b>LLM → tool → LLM</b> loops. A couple of file‑system functions already unlock powerful workflows.</p>
        <pre>
// Minimal toolset
const tools = {
  read_file: async ({ path }) => await fs.readFile(path, "utf8"),
  write_file: async ({ path, content }) => {
    await fs.writeFile(path, content)
    return "OK"
  },

    <h3>Enhancing form Accessibility with aria-live (2024)</h3>
    <p>
        <b>aria-live</b> is an ARIA attribute used to define regions of a web page that should be communicated
        to the user by assistive technologies, such as screen readers, as they are updated or changed dynamically.
    </p>
    <details>
        <summary>Read more...</summary>
        <p>
            The issue arises because aria-live regions are often not dynamically updated in a way that
            triggers screen readers to announce the changes. To ensure that screen readers announce the
            alert message, we need to define the alert as an aria-live region with an appropriate aria-live attribute.
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;form id="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm(event)"&gt;
  &lt;label for="name"&gt;Name:&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name" /&gt;
  &lt;button type="submit"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div role="status" aria-live="assertive" id="alertMessage"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <h3>Why I Use Tailwind CSS when building UI (2023)</h3>
    <p>
        Web development can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to designing and styling a website.
        In this post, I'll be sharing why I love using Tailwind CSS and why it's my go-to framework for web development.
    </p>

        <p>
            One of the best things about Tailwind CSS is its flexibility and customization options.
            The pre-designed CSS classes are consistent across all projects, making it easier to maintain a
            cohesive style across different pages and sections of a website.
        </p>
        <p>
            In today's world, mobile responsiveness is crucial for any website. Tailwind CSS includes a variety
            of responsive design classes that make it easy to create mobile-friendly layouts.
