## Understanding aria-live

aria-live is an ARIA attribute used to define regions of a web page that should be communicated to the user by assistive technologies, such as screen readers, as they are updated or changed dynamically. It enables developers to create a more responsive and accessible user experience by ensuring that important updates are conveyed in real time to users who may not be able to visually perceive those changes.

## Example Scenario: Alerting Users in a Form

Let’s consider a common scenario where aria-live can significantly enhance accessibility: a form submission with validation. Imagine a form where a user fills in their details and submits it. Upon submission, if there are errors in the form, an alert message should be displayed to notify the user about the issues.

## The Issue

The alert message may be dynamically injected into the DOM after form submission in many implementations. However, the screen reader might not announce the alert despite using aria-live, leaving users unaware of the validation errors.

## Why Doesn’t the Screen Reader Announce the Alert?

The issue arises because aria-live regions are often not dynamically updated in a way that triggers screen readers to announce the changes. Screen readers typically only announce changes to live regions when there’s a change in content. Since the alert is dynamically injected after the form submission and doesn’t have its aria-live attribute set, it may not be announced by the screen reader.

[assertive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-live#assertive)

Indicates that updates to the region have the highest priority and should be presented to the user immediately.

[off](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-live#off) (default)

Indicates that updates to the region should not be presented to the user unless the user is currently focused on that region.

[polite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-live#polite)

Indicates that updates to the region should be presented at the next graceful opportunity, such as at the end of speaking the current sentence or when the user pauses typing.

## The Solution

To ensure that screen readers announce the alert message, we need to define the alert as an aria-live region with an appropriate aria-live attribute. By doing so, we explicitly tell the screen reader that this region should be announced when its content changes.

```html
<form id="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm(event)">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
<div role="status" aria-live="assertive" id="alertMessage" class="alert"></div>
```
